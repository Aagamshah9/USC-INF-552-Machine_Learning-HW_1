Instead of giving the relative path for the input data file in the main code, here the "Notebook" folder itself consists of the main code as well as the input data file which will get called from the same folder when the main code is executed.
For execution download the "Notebook" folder and run the "Homework 1" file.
The results for the (d) and (e) parts have been uploaded in the "Results" Folder for reference.
